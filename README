Q1:
if the Google's Chrome browser creates new kernel level thread instead of new 
process for each tab it would not have the same benefit. 
the is reason is that the proccesses are isolated from each other, and that way
are more protected from each other - they do not share addres space and do not
communicate - if one tab crushes then it doesnt affect the other tabs.
on the other hand, creating, terminating and switching proccesses is 
much more slower then threads. 

Q2:
first, when we type "kill pid" with the keyboard we invoke an intterupt to the os.
then, after we press "enter", the os sends a kill signal to the process,
which terminates it. 

Q3:
'real' time is the actual time in the real world. 'virtual' time is time inside
a process. For example, we can use 'real' time to present the uesr the actual
time currently in Israel, and we can use 'virtual' time as in this excersice to
set a time unit called quantum used for setting the amount of time each thread
is running every cycle.

Q4:
a. None of the answers are common between the parent and child processes,
because each child process creates a copy of the global variables of its
parent.
b. pipe is a way for processes to communicate with each other. processes
can send and recieve data through the pipe. We can use the pipe to
communicate between a parent and child processes or between sibling
processes.
